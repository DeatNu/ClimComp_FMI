# ClimComp_FMI
This repository contains Python scripts for downloading and analyzing climate data.

The scripts have been made using Anaconda Python and thus it is recommended although regular Python
should also work especially with scripts that don't require Cartopy. I've tested all of the files on Windows and on WSL2 so they should work on both Windows and Linux.
Each file contains a Markdown cell with information about the required packages but there's also a YAML-file which can be used to set up a new conda environment with all required packages (install time: ~ 7 min).
